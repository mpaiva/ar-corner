# xR Lab - An intro to Invisible Interfaces

Welcome to my _Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Reality_ (xR) Lab.

I'm in a quest of creating a design process for _invisible interfaces_, this repo is the result of my studies and you are welcome to learn as I progress.

## Challenge
The current design tools are still very limited and in order to prototype XR interfaces, you need to have technical skills such as gaming development.

## Solution
Establish a simple set of tools that will allow any product designer with basic web development skills to understand, design and rapid prototype ideas.

## Step by step  
My goal is to create different branches as I progress, this way you will be able to follow the steps by simply changing the branches and learn it as well.

The long term goal is to present a series of workshops for local Miami designers and developers and make this material available for other communities.

## Getting Started
Here are the tools you will need to download before getting started:

- [Sketch App](https://sketchapp.com/)  - User interface design application for Mac.
- [Sketch to VR plugin](https://github.com/auxdesigner/Sketch-to-VR) - for exporting equirectangular images for a web interface.
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) - A web framework for building virtual reality experiences.
- [SimpleHTTPServer](http://www.scottmadethis.net/interactive/simpleserver/) - An automator script that allows you to simply start a web server from the contextual menu.

### Understanding the __x-Reality__ space

- __Virtual Reality__ - end-user experiences within an artificial world and visual elements;
- __Augmented Reality__ - end-user experiences an overlay of visual elements/information on real world environment;
- __Mixed Reality__ - end-user interacts with smart visual elements that are aware of its surroundings in a real world environment.

### What do you need to create an invisible interface?

- Smartphone Browser
- Smartphone Camera
- 3D models
- Tracking (marker, face, color, geo, object)


### Agenda
Clink on the links to follow steps.

- [__Step 1__](#) - Simple VR prototype using Sketch, equirectangular images and A-Frame.
- [__Step 2__](#) - Add 3D object into the space
- [__Step 3__](#) - Rotate 3D object
- [__Step 4__](#) - Design a tracking marker
- [__Step 5__](#) - Add a camera view.
- [__Step 6__](#) - Add tracking marker and 3d model into scene
- [__Step 7__](#) - Add object interaction

## Conclusion
There's a lot to learn, but the bottom line for me is that this is simpler than I had originally expected.
