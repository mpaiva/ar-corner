# Welcome to my Augmented/Virtual Reality (XR) Lab.

My goal is to create different branches as I progress, this way you will be able to follow the steps by simply changing the branches and learn it as well.

The intention is to present a series of workshops for local Miami designers and developers and make this material available for other communities.

# Step 1 - Goal
Create an overview on AR and evaluate the different elements necessary to design and prototype your first XR project.

## Dependencies for this step
- Sketch App
- Sketch to VR plugin
- A-Frame
- SimpleHTTPServer
